This is a PyTorch implementation of our paper "Rethinking Deep Active Learning for Medical Image Segmentation: A Diffusion and Angle-based Framework":

### For Diffusion-based Feature Extraction:
* We refer to the [Diffae](https://github.com/phizaz/diffae) for diffusion-based self-supervised training and feature extraction.

### For Angle-based Sampling:
* We release a demo in Jupyter Notebook [ABAL Sampler](https://github.com/miccaiif/ABAL/blob/main/ABOD.ipynb). More comparative sampling methods could be found in [Comparative Samplers](https://github.com/miccaiif/ABAL/tree/main/comparative_sampling_methods).
